Go through notebooks. You only need to complete and report exercises that start with "Homework Exercise X (Y points)". Into a PDF include screenshots of code with resulting figures and answers to questions (if any). Submit the PDF to gradescope.

There is a bonus exercise (2 bonus points). You need to use open Mask R-CNN implementation (from https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) instead of U-net for Homework Exercise: Splash of color. Report whatever will convince us that you completed this exercise (figures, link to your fork, modified code etc).
